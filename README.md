Connect4Project:
A project to make a connect 4 AI in python to practice python and machine learning/ai stuff.
Currently a work in progress, basic game functionality is complete at this point and can be used to randomly generate game data which will be used to train a neural net both from scratch and using python packages, likely either keras or tensorflow.
