Connect4Project:
A project to make a connect 4 AI in python to practice python and machine learning/ai stuff.
Includes a Connect 4 game and a basic neural net library. The Neural net library is also used to process handwritten digits from the mnist dataset to show it's generalizability. The library is fairly naive and unoptimized so it tends to train quite slowly.
Currently basic game functionality is complete and can be used to randomly generate game data which is used to train a neural net both from scratch and using tensorflow.
